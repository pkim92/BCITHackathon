<h2><b>BCIT Co-op Hackathon</b></h2>
<hr/>
The inaugural CST Hackathon was held for the first time for invite-only, top 50 CST co-op students on January 3rd, 2018. The hackathon was held for 30 hours, from Jan 3rd ~ Jan 4th. With the hackathon topic: ways to improve BCIT experience as a student, the event provided an excellent opportunity put my technical skills to a practical use, and to work in an agile environment. In a group of 5, our group managed to create a prototype of a functional myBCIT.ca website. The website contains a fully working calendar, a map, almost every working link from the original my.bcit.ca website.
